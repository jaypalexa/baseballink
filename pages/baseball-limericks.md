<h1>Baseball Limericks</h1>
<div class="storycontent">
  <h3>Albert Pujols</h3>
  <p><em>by TheUmpire</em><br />
    If pitching a shutout is one of your goals<br />
    Show batters your pinpoint control<br />
    Finesse them beaucoup<br />
    But whatever you do<br />
    Don’t hang a curveball near Albert Pujols
  </p>
  <h3>Bill Veeck</h3>
  <p><em>by BennettO</em><br />
    Leave it to Bill Veeck to finally fidget<br />
    To get attendance to reach double digits<br />
    Fireworks, “Ladies’ Day”<br />
    An organist and half-price pay<br />
    And to bat he would send up a midget
  </p>
  <h3>Montreal Expos Outfielders</h3>
  <p><em>by BennettO</em><br />
    Remember that outfield that was supposed to be awesome<br />
    With Valentine, Cromartie and Dawson?<br />
    Cromartie went Japanese<br />
    Dawson wore out his knees<br />
    And Valentine broke a few hearts so they tossed him
  </p>
  <h3>Philly Fans</h3>
  <p><em>by BennettO</em><br />
    In Philly their fans would boo Jesus<br />
    Asking “What’s he done lately to please us?”<br />
    “We’ve heard all the loud raves<br />
    Of how Jesus saves<br />
    So did he blow that late lead to appease us?”
  </p>
  <h3>Ernie Banks</h3>
  <p><em>by BennettO</em><br />
    When you ask Mr. Cub Ernie Banks<br />
    Asking “What’s he done lately to please us?”<br />
    “How could you play with inferior ranks?”<br />
    What with two MVP’s<br />
    Five hundred homers to please?<br />
    He just said “Let’s play two” and gave thanks
  </p>
  <h3>Roger Craig</h3>
  <p><em>by BennettO</em><br />
    Roger Craig taught to all the split finger<br />
    So that batters would not blast a dinger<br />
    If he saw an outsider<br />
    Toss a fastball or slider<br />
    He was thrown off the team as a ringer
  </p>
  <h3>Derek Jeter</h3>
  <p><em>by TheUmpire</em><br />
    There once was a Yankee named Jeter<br />
    Who proclaimed he was not a tax cheater<br />
    “I owe no more than the<br />
    next guy from Florida<br />
    who knows how to handle a heater!”
  </p>
  <h3>Barry Bonds</h3>
  <p><em>by TheUmpire</em><br />
    There’s a slugger in baseball named Barry<br />
    Who hits homers so often it’s scary<br />
    But he gets annoyed<br />
    When you ask him ’bout ’roids<br />
    If you’re around him you’d better be wary
  </p>
  <h3>Curt Schilling</h3>
  <p><em>by TheUmpire</em><br />
    There once was a pitcher named Schilling<br />
    Whose Game 6 performance was thrilling<br />
    But many an eye<br />
    Thought it red dye<br />
    Not the blood it was claimed he was spilling
  </p>
  <h3>Alex Rodriguez</h3>
  <p><em>by SamM</em><br />
    There once was a Yankee named Alex<br />
    Who neared the home run apex<br />
    He took his glove and his lumber<br />
    On holiday throughout October<br />
    Yet George kept sending the paychecks
  </p>
  <h3>Bud Selig</h3>
  <p><em>by SamM</em><br />
    There once was a man named Selig<br />
    Who vied to be baseball’s bigwig<br />
    He couldn’t rely on class<br />
    To be among the top brass<br />
    So he slimed his way into the gig
  </p>
  <h3>The Minors in 2010</h3>
  <p><em>by TheUmpire</em><br />
    For future autograph signers<br />
    It is no longer fun in the minors<br />
    HGH shown the door<br />
    Maple bats are no more<br />
    And we are already hearing some whiners
  </p>
  <h3>Ryan Howard for Albert Pujols</h3>
  <p><em>by TheUmpire</em><br />
    Albert Pujols traded to Philly?<br />
    I imagine nothing more silly<br />
    Plus when he returned<br />
    To the city he spurned<br />
    His reception would be a bit chilly
  </p>
  <h3>Gaylord Perry</h3>
  <p><em>by SamM</em><br />
    There once was pitcher named Perry<br />
    Of whom many an umpire was wary<br />
    If he didn’t throw a spitter<br />
    To each and every hitter<br />
    Then there must also be a Tooth Fairy
  </p>
  <h3>Sammy Sosa</h3>
  <p><em>by SamM</em><br />
    There once was a slugger named Sosa<br />
    Who could whack it across The Ponderosa<br />
    They took his steroids away<br />
    And the very next day<br />
    He was batting like Omarosa
  </p>
  <h3>Spaceman</h3>
  <p><em>by Scottie</em><br />
    Astro-turf was the bane of his days.<br />
    The DH caused him endless dismays.<br />
    Though a purist of sorts,<br />
    He loved grass (by reports),<br />
    Bill Lee never ceased to amaze.
  </p>
  <h3>Ichiro</h3>
  <p><em>by Scottie</em><br />
    There was a young man named Suzuki<br />
    As swift as an unleashed Saluki<br />
    His only true obstacle?<br />
    He found English impossible!<br />
    But it was baseball or acting Kabuki
  </p>
  <h3>An A’s Fan</h3>
  <p><em>by StaunchSombrero</em><br />
    In the eighties I followed the A’s<br />
    Bleacher seats and a beer-induced haze<br />
    Canseco, LaRussa<br />
    Now it’s hard to get used ta<br />
    How badly they are nowadays
  </p>
  <h3>Bert Blyleven</h3>
  <p><em>by TommyT</em><br />
    There once was a hurler named Blyleven<br />
    Whose curveball descended from heaven<br />
    Getting into the Hall<br />
    Was all wait and all stall<br />
    Currently double minimum plus seven
  </p>
  <h3>Satchel</h3>
  <p><em>by Scottie</em><br />
    Satchel Paige of historic acclaim,<br />
    Who threw baseballs as if they were flame,<br />
    Through no fault of his own,<br />
    But because of skin tone,<br />
    Was denied his true place in the game.
  </p>
  <h3>Number 45</h3>
  <p><em>by TommyT</em><br />
    The pitcher – nickname of Gibby<br />
    Intimidator? That’s not a fibby<br />
    Glaring from the mound<br />
    Fastball speed of sound<br />
    Gonna put one right in your ribby
  </p>
  <h3>Roger Clemens</h3>
  <p><em>by SamM</em><br />
    There once was a pitcher named Roger<br />
    Who played until he was an old codger<br />
    Many would later deduce<br />
    He on some kind of juice<br />
    Yet he proved an effective truth dodger
  </p>
  <h3>The North Side Cries Again</h3>
  <p><em>by StaunchSombrero</em><br />
    The Cubs win The Series this year!<br />
    Redemption, fans vow, is quite near<br />
    Hope springs eternal<br />
    But the pain is infernal:<br />
    No shot at the playoffs, I fear.
  </p>
  <h3>Barry Bonds and Defiance</h3>
  <p><em>by PhilosopherStone</em><br />
    Barry Bonds played his last with the Giants<br />
    Though not totally in full compliance<br />
    With biceps steroidal<br />
    He hit that spheroidal<br />
    With a certain amount of defiance
  </p>
  <h3>Kent Tekulve</h3>
  <p><em>by SamM</em><br />
    There once was a reliever named Tekulve<br />
    You young fellas might ask, who’s he?<br />
    Bespectacled and thin as a rail<br />
    His sidearm seemed to hail<br />
    All the way from Tallahassee
  </p>
  <h3>Bernie Carbo</h3>
  <p><em>by SamM</em><br />
    There once was a slugger named Carbo<br />
    An in-the-clutch swinging maestro<br />
    High as a kite<br />
    Every single night<br />
    His homers would land in the Congo
  </p>
  <h3>Pete Rose</h3>
  <p><em>by SamM</em><br />
    There once was a Red named Rose<br />
    Who had a myriad of foes<br />
    Neither the Mets second B<br />
    Nor A. Bartlett Giamatti<br />
    Ever thought him the nicest of fellows
  </p>
  <h3>Bill Lee</h3>
  <p><em>by SamM</em><br />
    There once was a pitcher named Lee<br />
    A mystery from which planet came he<br />
    Whether part of the human race<br />
    Or a descendent from outer space<br />
    His antics will live through history
  </p>
  <h3>Don Mattingly</h3>
  <p><em>by SamM</em><br />
    Up to the plate stepped Mattingly<br />
    Twirling his bat enchantingly<br />
    If hitting is an art<br />
    Then Don was a Mozart<br />
    Or maybe a Rembrandt, you see
  </p>
  <h3>Danny Ainge</h3>
  <p><em>by SamM</em><br />
    I don’t want to be here, said Ainge<br />
    Methinks it’s time for a change<br />
    Rather than make double plays<br />
    For the lowly Blue Jays<br />
    I’ll be shooting from three-point range
  </p>
  <h3>2012 MLB Salaries</h3>
  <p><em>by TheUmpire</em><br />
    Salaries up four percent<br />
    Whilst the rest of us struggle for rent<br />
    The min’s half a mil<br />
    Yet we go see them still<br />
    Attendance continues ascent
  </p>
  <h3>Rakuten’s Most Golden Eagle?</h3>
  <p><em>by TheUmpire</em><br />
    Andruw Jones signed a deal in Japan<br />
    To perk up his career if he can<br />
    His last five seasons were bad<br />
    So I’m sure he’ll be glad<br />
    If he can once again be “the man”
  </p>
  <h3>Ozzie Smith</h3>
  <p><em>by TheUmpire</em><br />
    Up the middle the Oz was a wiz<br />
    Backflips and DPs were his biz<br />
    Other shortstops shed tears<br />
    ’Cuz for 13 straight years<br />
    Every Gold Glove awarded was his
  </p>
  <h3>Carlton Fisk Burglarized</h3>
  <p><em>by TheUmpire</em><br />
    The police didn’t see whilst patrollin’<br />
    Pudge’s collectible coins being stolen<br />
    Always a risk<br />
    Trying to steal off Fisk<br />
    Many baserunners still need consolin’
  </p>
  <h3>A-Rod Linked</h3>
  <p><em>by TheUmpire</em><br />
    The Miami New Times has inked<br />
    That A-Rod is once again linked<br />
    To performance enhancers<br />
    No definitive answers<br />
    But Yankees must feel hoodwinked
  </p>
  <h3>Spring Training</h3>
  <p><em>by TheUmpire</em><br />
    In all of the world of sport<br />
    The four words of highest import<br />
    Uttered each February<br />
    As sweet as a cherry<br />
    “Pitchers and catchers report”
  </p>
  <h3>Josh Booty Redux</h3>
  <p><em>by TheUmpire</em><br />
    MLB’s “The Next Knuckler” show<br />
    Revealed who had the best throw<br />
    Former first-rounder Josh Booty<br />
    Beat out Doug Flutie<br />
    So to D-Backs spring training he’ll go
  </p>
  <h3>Skydiving Brian Cashman</h3>
  <p><em>by TheUmpire</em><br />
    Brian Cashman did something insane<br />
    Jumped out of a functioning plane<br />
    Not completely outstanding<br />
    A terrible landing<br />
    Left the Yankees GM in some pain
  </p>
  <h3>Tim McCarver Retires</h3>
  <p><em>by TheUmpire</em><br />
    McCarver says he’s gonna quit<br />
    Not an unwelcome obit<br />
    For the last 18 years<br />
    He’s been noise in my ears<br />
    His announcing gives me a fit
  </p>
  <h3>Five WP in One Inning</h3>
  <p><em>by TheUmpire</em><br />
    Cubs hurlers to start digging ditches?<br />
    One inning, five wild pitches!<br />
    Just as surreal<br />
    As watching Ankiel<br />
    Suffer from similar glitches
  </p>
  <h3>Prince Harry in Harlem</h3>
  <p><em>by TheUmpire</em><br />
    Prince Harry went long ball in Harlem<br />
    And whilst not exactly stardom<br />
    Having skills such as that<br />
    He could swing his next bat<br />
    With the horrible Miami Marlins
  </p>
  <h3>MLB 2014 Opening Series</h3>
  <p><em>by TheUmpire</em><br />
    Sydney will be the scene<br />
    For the first time it’s ever been<br />
    Aussies will wonder<br />
    What’s happening Down Under<br />
    When MLB opens in 2014
  </p>
  <h3>Homer Bailey</h3>
  <p><em>by TheUmpire</em><br />
    Homer Bailey relied on his splitter<br />
    With a masterful bit of a flitter<br />
    To Giants batters transfix<br />
    And go perfect through six<br />
    Notching his second no-hitter
  </p>
  <h3>Tim Hudson Breaks Ankle</h3>
  <p><em>by TheUmpire</em><br />
    A routine play so often rehearsed<br />
    Tim Hudson went to go cover first<br />
    Eric Young was called out<br />
    But Hudson’s future’s in doubt<br />
    Broken ankle now needs to be nursed
  </p>
  <h3>4000 and Counting</h3>
  <p><em>by TheUmpire</em><br />
    Ichiro reached 4000 hits<br />
    Shows no sign of calling it quits<br />
    Pete Rose is on top<br />
    Ty Cobb the next stop<br />
    Suzuki will keep up his blitz
  </p>
  <h3>Baseball Strikes Out of 2020</h3>
  <p><em>by TheUmpire</em><br />
    Though lobbied for by cognoscenti<br />
    With impassioned appeals aplenty<br />
    It is with sad heart I report<br />
    Baseball will not be a sport<br />
    In the Olympic Games of 2020
  </p>
  <h3>A-Rod New Grand Slam Leader</h3>
  <p><em>by TheUmpire</em><br />
    It occurred as a matter of course<br />
    For such an explosive offensive force<br />
    The home-run tsunami<br />
    Hit his 24th salami<br />
    A-Rod has surpassed Iron Horse
  </p>
  <h3>No Mo No Mo</h3>
  <p><em>by TheUmpire</em><br />

    Farewell Mariano Rivera
  </p>
  <h3>Boston Wins 2013 WS at Fenway</h3>
  <p><em>by TheUmpire</em><br />
    The Red Sox produced with elate<br />
    World Series crown number eight<br />
    MVP for Ortiz<br />
    His hits were the keys<br />
    To ending 95 years of home wait
  </p>
  <h3>2013 AL MVP &#8211; Miguel Cabrera</h3>
  <p><em>by TheUmpire</em><br />
    The Tigers&rsquo; Miguel Cabrera<br />
    Continued his offensive terror<br />
    Hitting .348<br />
    Is certainly great<br />
    Just wish defensive miscues were rarer
  </p>
  <h3>2013 NL MVP &#8211; Andrew McCutchen</h3>
  <p><em>by TheUmpire</em><br />
    Cutch pushed the Bucs into postseason<br />
    Clutch hitting a part of the reason<br />
    And baserunners dismissed<br />
    By eleven assists<br />
    To dis the Pirates this year would be treason
  </p>
  <h3>2013 AL Cy Young &#8211; Max Scherzer</h3>
  <p><em>by TheUmpire</em><br />
    With a win-loss of 21-3<br />
    AL&rsquo;s best pitcher must certainly be<br />
    Detroit starter Max Scherzer<br />
    Turned each batter into a curser<br />
    With a point nine seven oh WHIP
  </p>
  <h3>2013 NL Cy Young &#8211; Clayton Kershaw</h3>
  <p><em>by TheUmpire</em><br />
    Dodgers ace Clayton Kershaw<br />
    Turned sluggers into bourgeois<br />
