<H2>Letter From The Publisher</H2>

Welcome to Baseball Ink.  My goal is to celebrate baseball the way it was meant to be:  fun, magical, nostalgic.  You'll find no artificial turf here.  Pitchers hit for themselves.  Real beef in the hot dogs, buns freshly steamed.  Mustard only.<BR>
<BR>
I would like very much for you to share your baseball stories here.  Memories, fact, fiction, prose, poetry, art -- they are all welcome.  I'll throw in an occasional feature.  Let's ignore the Rockers and Strawberrys and let some of baseball's good news play for a bit, okay?  We could all use more of that.<BR>
<BR>
I hope to publish a quarterly print magazine.  In addition to promoting the print mag, the Web site will provide forums for baseball-related discussions (Themes, Around the Hot Stove) as well as a mechanism to submit work, to purchase subscriptions and merchandise, and to link to other baseball-related sites.<BR>
<BR>
I look forward to hearing your suggestions and receiving your submissions.  Please feel free to send me an e-mail and let me know what you think.<BR>
<BR>
J. P. Alexander<BR>
Publisher, Baseball Ink<BR>
