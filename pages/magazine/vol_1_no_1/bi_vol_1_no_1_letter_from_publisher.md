<h1>Letter From The Publisher</h1>
<p>
  Welcome to Baseball Ink.  My goal is to celebrate baseball the way it was meant to be:  fun, magical, nostalgic.  You'll find no artificial turf here.  Pitchers hit for themselves.  Real beef in the hot dogs, buns freshly steamed.  Mustard only.
</p>

<p>
  I would like very much for you to share your baseball stories here.  Memories, fact, fiction, prose, poetry, art &mdash; they are all welcome.  I'll throw in an occasional feature.  Let's ignore the Rockers and Strawberrys and let some of baseball's good news play for a bit, okay?  We could all use more of that.
</p>

<p>
  I hope to publish a quarterly print magazine.  In addition to promoting the print mag, the Web site will provide forums for baseball-related discussions (Themes, Around the Hot Stove) as well as a mechanism to submit work, to purchase subscriptions and merchandise, and to link to other baseball-related sites.
</p>

<p>
  I look forward to hearing your suggestions and receiving your submissions.  Please feel free to send me an e-mail and let me know what you think.
</p>

  Publisher, <em>Baseball Ink</em>
