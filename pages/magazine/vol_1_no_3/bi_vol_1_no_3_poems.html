<H2>Baseball Poems</H2>
<i>by Dan Zamudio</i>


<U>Bat boy</U>

Steady
breeze rustles his
oversized uniform
as he kneels outside our home team
dugout

and waits
patiently for
the moment when both hands
will hold smooth pine still trembling from
a hit.

<u>Confucius says</u>

Only two things can last forever ï¿½

an old baseball mitt
with softened leather
and a double-header
delayed by
stormy weather.

rolls of action photos while he played catch with strangers on Wrigley Field after a long tour.
