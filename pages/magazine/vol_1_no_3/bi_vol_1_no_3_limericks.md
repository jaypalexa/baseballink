  <h1>Baseball Limericks</h1>
  <p><em>by Bennett Oberfeld</em></p>

  <p>
    Roger Craig taught to all the split finger<br />
    So that batters would not blast a dinger<br />
    If he saw an outsider<br />
    Toss a fastball or slider<br />
    He was thrown off the team as a ringer
  </p>

  <p>
    The Reds bullpen was full of high fliers<br />
    Led by the top flake, lefty Randy Myers<br />
    He teamed up with Ron Dibble<br />
    For more psyches than Sybil<br />
    Plus Norm Charlton, the king of live wires
  </p>

  <p>
    <em>Bennett Oberfeld has been a die-hard baseball fan for over 30 years, rooting for home town teams starting with the Orioles, to the Cubs, now for the Braves.  He has been to 24 of the 30 existing ball parks, but refuses to see a game in Montreal Olympic Stadium or the Metrodome.</em>
