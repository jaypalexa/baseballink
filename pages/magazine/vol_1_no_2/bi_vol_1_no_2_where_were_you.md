<h1>Where Were You When McGwire Hit 62?</h1>
<h2>A song by Allen Levi</h2>

  <p>
  Where were you when he stepped up to the batter's box<br />
  Where were you when he hovered at the plate<br />
  Where were you on the moment he made history<br />
  On the 8th day of September nineteen hundred ninety eight
  </p>

  <p>
  Where were you when he took our minds off all our cares<br />
  Where were you when he almost missed first base<br />
  Where were you when the whole world stopped to celebrate<br />
  When with a single stroke he put a smile on every face
  </p>

  <p>
  I was changing strings on my guitar<br />
  Sitting in a straight back chair<br />
  But I jumped right up like the hometown crowd<br />
  And cheered like I was really there
  </p>

  <p>
  Where were you when he picked his son up at the plate<br />
  And when he hugged that good old Sammy Sosa just the same<br />
  Where were you when everybody got along <br />
  And the game was so much more, so much more than just a game
  </p>

  <p>
  We all need heroes good and big and strong <br />
  Seems we found one over in St. Lou<br />
  Where were you at 9:18 that Tuesday night<br />
  Where were you when McGwire hit 62?
  </p>
