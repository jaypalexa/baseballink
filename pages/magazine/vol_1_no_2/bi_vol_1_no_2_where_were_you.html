<H2>Where were you when McGwire hit 62?</H2>
<I>A song by Allen Levi</I><BR>
<BR>

Where were you when he stepped up to the batter's box<BR>
Where were you when he hovered at the plate<BR>
Where were you on the moment he made history<BR>
On the 8th day of September nineteen hundred ninety eight<BR>
<BR>

Where were you when he took our minds off all our cares<BR>
Where were you when he almost missed first base<BR>
Where were you when the whole world stopped to celebrate<BR>
When with a single stroke he put a smile on every face<BR>
<BR>

I was changing strings on my guitar<BR>
Sitting in a straight back chair<BR>
But I jumped right up like the hometown crowd<BR>
And cheered like I was really there<BR>
<BR>

Where were you when he picked his son up at the plate<BR>
And when he hugged that good old Sammy Sosa just the same<BR>
Where were you when everybody got along <BR>
And the game was so much more, so much more than just a game<BR>
<BR>

We all need heroes good and big and strong <BR>
Seems we found one over in St. Lou<BR>
Where were you at 9:18 that Tuesday night<BR>
Where were you when McGwire hit 62? <BR>
<BR>
