<h3>Tuesday, March 7, 2000</h3>
<p>
  My wife, Sally, and I left Seattle headed for Cancun. Our stay there for four days was to prepare for our "illegal" entry into Cuba. Legal or illegal, we were informed that we would be part of the first ever senior men's team from America to play baseball in Cuba. The operative word is "senior," although we were merely 20-year-old kids in 60-plus bodies.
</p>

<h3>Wednesday-Friday, March 8-10, 2000</h3>
<p>
  Being from Seattle, we spent these few days in the Mexican sun for a quick "spring training." Actually, we did more relaxing than working out.
</p>

<h3>Saturday, March 11, 2000</h3>
<p>
  That evening we played a little "Russian roulette." There are only two Mexican flights each day to Havana, one on a DC-9 and the other on a Russian-made Aeroflot. Luckily, we boarded a DC-9 for Havana. We landed in the dark so it was difficult to get much of an initial impression of the city. As we were making our final approach, I glanced over at Sally. She had that, "What in the world am I doing here?" look on her face. Except for two players who entered Cuba by way of Nassau and Jamaica, the rest of our players on the East Coast came into Cuba by way of Toronto. All 16 players (and eight wives or significant others) transferred from the Havana airport to the El Bosque Hotel. It was nice per Cuban standards, but mediocre for the U.S.
</p>

<h3>Sunday, March 12, 2000</h3>
<p>
  That morning we traveled by bus (made in Brazil) through the countryside for about two hours to the Pinar del Rio area and the La Ermita Hotel, located in a beautiful, pristine setting overlooking a valley of Vinales, with mountains in the background. Accompanying us was Jesus Barreso Gutierrez, representing the Cuban Baseball Federation. He was very interesting and informative. For example, Jesus mentioned that El Duque (New York Yankees) was considered a "good, but definitely not great" pitcher by Cuban standards. Driving from Havana we noticed the lack of any transportation on the roads and the pervasive poverty. Still, the country has so much potential, if the political and economic systems would only change. During the trip we saw only a handful of cars and no gas stations -- only bikes and trucks hauling 15-to-20 workers, all standing up in the back, to the fields. Some Cuban farmers have a quasi-incentive program to produce crops. Up to a certain amount, all crop production goes to the government. Any excess is kept by the farmer. There is no private property.
</p>

<p>
  We played a "practice game" in the local stadium against much younger players from the nearby town. Being Sunday, it seemed like most of the town came out to the game -- approximately 500 fans. They weren't disappointed. Home Team 34, Americans/Canadians 2. The Cuban kids hit four home runs, one by their first baseman that would have cleared the Grand Canyon.
</p>

<p>
  After the game I asked where most of the players came from and where they played baseball, etc. I was told that they were just kids, mostly hotel employees and other town residents, who didn't play that much anymore. I mentioned that it was interesting that they could put together a team of that caliber from a rather limited geographical area. The coach seemed a little perplexed by my comments. He responded by saying, "That's no problem because in Cuba everyone plays baseball."
</p>

<p>
  That evening we had dinner at the hotel, and half of the band who entertained us had played against us earlier that day.
</p>

<h3>Monday, March 13, 2000</h3>
<p>
  Because of our "impressive" display on the previous day, our Cuban hosts decided to upgrade our opposition. Today we faced older players, ages 42 to around 55 years; however, half (10) of them at one time had played for the Cuban national team, including their starting pitcher, Julio Rivero. At age 50, he easily threw the ball in the mid-80's. The remaining players on their roster played on provincial teams. The game was played at the stadium, called the Capitan San Luis, a revolutionary hero, or Pinar del Rio Estadio -- again before a pretty decent crowd. We lost, 12-0, not bad compared to the previous day!
</p>

<p>
  It was obvious to us that our hosts were -- and still are -- amazing baseball players. What stood out was their quickness, despite their ages and slight builds. We witnessed quickness in the field, arm strength, and especially their incredible bat speed. They also showed a deep love for the game.
</p>

<p>
  On the bus with us, hitching a ride to the games, was an ex-Cuban national team player, Roberto Moreno. Even though he couldn't speak English, his infectious smile and personality won us over. During one of the games, he made a Brooks Robinson-like play at third. He said he was 45, but he looked no more than 35.
</p>

<p>
  After the game we had a tour of the caves of the ancient Indians, then had lunch and bonded with the Cubans. Everyone toasted new friendships by indulging in too many Cuban cigars. Many of the Cuban players did not know of Ken Griffrey Jr. They were familiar with Willie Mays. Speaking of great ballplayers, one of the best in Cuban history, Omar Linares, makes $20 per month, which is comparable to a medical doctor's salary. Linares is a member of the Communist Party and receives certain "fringe benefits" like a Mercedes, unlimited expense account at restaurants and hotels, plus the freedom to travel. All Cuban players are considered "amateurs."
