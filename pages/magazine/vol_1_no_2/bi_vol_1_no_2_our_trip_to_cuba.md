<h3>Tuesday, March 7, 2000</h3>

  My wife, Sally, and I left Seattle headed for Cancun. Our stay there for four days was to prepare for our "illegal" entry into Cuba. Legal or illegal, we were informed that we would be part of the first ever senior men's team from America to play baseball in Cuba. The operative word is "senior," although we were merely 20-year-old kids in 60-plus bodies.

<h3>Wednesday-Friday, March 8-10, 2000</h3>
<p>
  Being from Seattle, we spent these few days in the Mexican sun for a quick "spring training." Actually, we did more relaxing than working out.
