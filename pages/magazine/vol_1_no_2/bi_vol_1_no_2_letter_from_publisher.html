<H2>Letter From The Publisher</H2>

Is the magic gone?<BR>
<BR>

A bit melodramatic, perhaps, but given the current state of the game – at both the major league and minor league levels – it is a question I find myself asking.<BR>
<BR>


A number of observations disturb me.  I witnessed a brawl on the field at a minor league park which was completely uncalled for and entirely out of control.  I heard fans cheering for the brawl itself – much the same mentality (or idiocy) possessed by fans who go to the race track to see a wreck or to a hockey game to see a fight.  I paid over $6.00 for a beer at a major league game and as much as $3.75 for a beer at a short-season Class A game.  (I won't even go into ticket prices.)  I sat in ballparks named after corporations.  I hear rumblings of another major league strike or lockout, and I sympathize with neither camp of millionaires.<BR>
<BR>


On the other hand, the laughter I heard from a couple of minor league outfielders <B><I>playing</B></I> catch during warm-ups encourages me.  My heart smiles when I see a father teaching his child how to score a game.  A number of extremely helpful and gracious ballpark personnel have served me, my family, and friends.  I have visited some excellent baseball-related Web sites dedicated to promoting the history of the game.  And, I think you will see, I have received some very inspired writing for this issue of Baseball Ink.<BR>
<BR>


No clear answer to my question, yet I find it worrisome that the issue can be debated at all.<BR>
<BR>


All in all, I have hope that the magic <B><I>is</B></I> still there.  And I hope that this magazine does its part to help keep it alive.<BR>
<BR>


Write us and let us know what you think.<BR>
<BR>
