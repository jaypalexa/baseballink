  <h2>Batting Practice</h2>

  <p>
    I like going to batting practice at the game. It gives me a chance to see what crazy contraptions people have come up with to get the ball.
  </p>

  <p>
    I like to see how well the players hit the ball. It may not seem like it, but most swings miss during the actual game.
  </p>

  <p>
    I like batting practice because the players aren't as nervous about losing the game or having tons of fans criticize them, so they hit more balls into the seats.
