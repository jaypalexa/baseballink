  <h1>Baseball Poems</h1>
  <p><em>by Dan Zamudio</em></p>

  <h2>Shiloh Park&mdash;Zion, Illinois</h2>

  <p>
    Old library,<br />
    recently converted<br />
    into a Senior Center,<br />
    looms deep across<br />
    center field grass.
  </p>

  <p>
    Little league<br />
    batters<br />
    swing at chest<br />
    high pitches<br />
    desperate<br />
    to crank a ball<br />
    onto the roof
  </p>

  <p>
    just once.
  </p>

  <p>
    Old-timers<br />
    watch from behind<br />
    glass windows<br />
    and boast<br />
    among each other,<br />
    embellishing<br />
    baseball stories
  </p>

  <p>
    of their youth.
  </p>

  <h2>Welcome to the Majors, Kid!</h2>

  <p>
    Fast ball<br />
    sizzles across<br />
    the strike zone
  </p>

  <p>
    chest high
  </p>

  <p>
    before smoldering<br />
    inside their catcher's<br />
    steady mitt.
  </p>

  <p>
    Laughter erupts<br />
    from inside the visitor dugout<br />
    as I step inches from<br />
    home plate,<br />
    inhale a calming breath,<br />
    then carefully<br />
    prepare my batting stance<br />
    for another<br />
    big league pitch.
  </p>

  <h2>Opening Day in Chicago</h2>

  <p>
    Baseball<br />
    season begins<br />
    on a cold afternoon<br />
    as blankets warm cheering fans and
  </p>

  <p>
    the first pitch soars across home plate<br />
    stinging our catchers hand<br />
    frozen inside<br />
    his mitt.
  </p>

    rolls of action photos while he played catch with strangers on Wrigley Field after a long tour.</em>
