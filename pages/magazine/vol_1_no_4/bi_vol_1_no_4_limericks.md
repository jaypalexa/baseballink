  <h1>Baseball Limericks</h1>
  <p><em>by Bennett Oberfeld</em></p>

  <p>
    When you ask Mr. Cub Ernie Banks<br />
    "How could you play with inferior ranks?"<br />
    What with two MVP's<br />
    Five hundred homers to please?<br />
    He just said "Let's play two" and gave thanks
  </p>

  <p>
    In Philly their fans would boo Jesus<br />
    Asking "What's he done lately to please us?"<br />
    "We've heard all the loud raves<br />
    Of how Jesus saves<br />
    So did he blow that late lead to appease us?"
  </p>

    <em>Bennett Oberfeld has been a die-hard baseball fan for over 30 years, rooting for home town teams starting with the Orioles, to the Cubs, now for the Braves.  He has been to 24 of the 30 existing ball parks, but refuses to see a game in Montreal Olympic Stadium or the Metrodome.</em>
