  <h1>Opening Day 2000</h1>
  <p><em>by Bill Burns</em></p>

  <p>
    And again it is time...<br />
    and you know it.<br />
    Without looking at the calendar<br />
    you know it's the time<br />
    because you can smell it in the air<br />
    and feel it on your neck and back.<br />
    You hear the rising voices of the young<br />
    as they begin again<br />
    to toss the ball around.<br />
    So...<br />
    you get ready one more time<br />
    for that first trip to the park<br />
    to see the boys play the game<br />
    again.
  </p>

  <p>
    It's baseball.
  </p>

  <p>
    BASEBALL...
  </p>

  <p>
    Not more than life,<br />
    but pretty damn close.<br />
    Something you can love<br />
    eat<br />
    breathe<br />
    taste<br />
    & hold onto...<br />
    a language all its own<br />
    that you can share with friends,<br />
    your wife,<br />
    your children,<br />
    strangers even.
  </p>

  <p>
    And so you must go<br />
    once again<br />
    to feel it and hold onto it,<br />
    to savor and be hurt by it...<br />
    to jump for joy and cry in deep despair...<br />
    to make it a part of you<br />
    before it's gone...<br />
    or you are.
  </p>
