<H3>All Good Things</H3>

Baseball Ink magazine as a print venture is coming to a halt for the time being. My personal interest in the production and editorial aspect of the magazine is still high, but I haven't been able to motivate myself to get the marketing/sales end off the ground.

I don't have the expertise or the inclination to pursue the marketing/sales portion�simply, it is just not my gig.  I would be more than happy to consider partnering with someone who has the passion for baseball and the magazine and is willing to take on this "hobby" with me.  A large part of the problem is that I have no money to offer a marketing/sales person�that is why that person is going to have to get involved "for love of the game" at this po

I am willing to entertain any ideas and possibilities for the business side of Baseball Ink magazine.  The format, distribution, content, and general direction are all open for discussion.

I do intend to keep Baseball Ink alive as an Internet endeavor, at least for the foreseeable future.  This will allow me to continue to publish quality content for a small fraction of the cost.  Though the electronic format won't be as physically gratifying, it will keep the coals glowing until destiny moves me again.  See you online at www.baseballink.com!

Note:  I am no longer accepting new subscriptions.  Existing subscriptions will be reimbursed.
