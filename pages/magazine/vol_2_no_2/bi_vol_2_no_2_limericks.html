Remember that outfield that was supposed to be awesome
With Valentine, Cromartie and Dawson?
Cromartie went Japanese
Dawson wore out his knees
And Valentine broke a few hearts so they tossed 'em

Leave it to Bill Veeck to finally fidget
To get attendance to reach double digit
Fireworks, "Ladies' Day"
An organist and half-price pay
And to bat he would send up a midget
