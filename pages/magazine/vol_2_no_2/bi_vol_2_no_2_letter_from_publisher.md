  <h1>Letter From The Publisher</h1>
  <h2>All Good Things</h2>

  <p>
    <em>Baseball Ink</em> magazine as a print venture is coming to a halt for the time being. My personal interest in the production and editorial aspect of the magazine is still high, but I haven't been able to motivate myself to get the marketing/sales end off the ground.
  </p>

  <p>
    I don't have the expertise or the inclination to pursue the marketing/sales portion...simply, it is just not my gig.  I would be more than happy to consider partnering with someone who has the passion for baseball and the magazine and is willing to take on this "hobby" with me.  A large part of the problem is that I have no money to offer a marketing/sales person...that is why that person is going to have to get involved "for love of the game" at this point.
  </p>

  <p>
    I am willing to entertain any ideas and possibilities for the business side of <em>Baseball Ink</em> magazine.  The format, distribution, content, and general direction are all open for discussion.
  </p>

  <p>
    I do intend to keep <em>Baseball Ink</em> alive as an Internet endeavor, at least for the foreseeable future.  This will allow me to continue to publish quality content for a small fraction of the cost.  Though the electronic format won't be as physically gratifying, it will keep the coals glowing until destiny moves me again.  See you online at <a href="http://www.baseballink.com">www.baseballink.com</a>!

    Note:  I am no longer accepting new subscriptions.  Existing subscriptions will be reimbursed.

    Publisher, <em>Baseball Ink</em>
