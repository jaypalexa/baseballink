  <h1>Game 2 of the 2000 World Series</h1>
  <p><em>by Rick Walunas</em></p>

  <p>
    Game 1 of the Series<br />
    Took two days to play,<br />
    But the Yanks were the winners<br />
    So that was O.K.
  </p>

  <p>
    Game 2 was more normal<br />
    Both in time and space<br />
    The Mets had been scoreless<br />
    The Yanks in their face.
  </p>

  <p>
    Now the 7th had ended,<br />
    5 to "Oh" was the score,<br />
    My eyelids were heavy<br />
    I could take no more.
  </p>

  <p>
    So I turned off the tube<br />
    And drifted happily to sleep.<br />
    The Yanks were ahead...<br />
    The shutout they'd keep.
  </p>

  <p>
    Then, what to my bleary eyes<br />
    Should arrive<br />
    But the morning newspaper,<br />
    Yanks Win 6 to 5.
  </p>

  <p>
    What could have happened<br />
    I read every page,<br />
    Don't tell me The Rocket<br />
    Went into a rage.
  </p>

  <p>
    Did he throw at Piazza<br />
    Or toss a bat down to first.<br />
    What! They brought in Jeff Nelson<br />
    What could be worse.
  </p>

  <p>
    So, no matter the score<br />
    Be it 20 to zip,<br />
    Now pay close attention<br />
    To this Yankee tip,
  </p>

  <p>
    Don't go to sleep<br />
    And expect them to breeze,<br />
    'Cause if the bullpen gets in,<br />
    Better pray on your knees!!
  </p>
